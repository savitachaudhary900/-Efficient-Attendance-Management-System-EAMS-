# -Efficient-Attendance-Management-System-EAMS-
 Developed an Academic Attendance Tracker,
 a streamlined system for managing student attendance in academic institutions. 
The project featured key modules, including an Attendance Controller for recording and reporting attendance,
 a Student Controller for managing student details, a Subject Controller for assigning and tracking subjects, and a User
 Controller for secure role-based access. The system automated attendance processes, provided analytics and reporting,
 and ensured efficient user management, significantly reducing manual efforts and improving accuracy. 
Built using Spring Boot, Hibernate, MySQL, and tested with Postman, the project is scalable and adaptable for diverse academic environments.
